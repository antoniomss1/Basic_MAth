# Basic MAth

An app to parctice the times table, and beyond. That's the main idea

It is just a way to practice mechanical abilities like calculation. A few friends had problems with these basic calculations, and I wanted to be able to calculate faster things like 13x15 or 12x19 (the table time until 20 for example, or some way to learn the 12 base system, which I will implement), but I didn't like the apps that I found, and wanted to learn from the experience of building an app, so now it's been my way to practice git, programming, code architecturing and planning and other things. A fez thigns were created because a few friends asked for theam like the zen mode and date practice mode (date finding). There's still a lot to come...
